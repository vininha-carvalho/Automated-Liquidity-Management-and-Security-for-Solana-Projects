# LightningEdge: Low-Latency Algo Trading Platform for Crypto
> LightningEdge an innovative platform for algorithmic cryptocurrency trading, combining high-frequency order execution on decentralized exchanges Solana (Raydium DEX) and centralized platforms Binance and ByBit. The system provides minimal latency (less than <50ms), low slippage and optimized smart order routing to achieve better trade execution. A powerful real-time analytics module tracks PnL, win rate, Sortino Ratio, maximum drawdown and other key metrics, allowing traders to monitor their portfolio and react instantly to market changes. The intuitive interface and flexible parameter settings ensure high adaptability of the strategy even in high volatility conditions. This software is an ideal tool for professional traders seeking to increase the efficiency and profitability of their trading strategies using advanced machine learning and algorithmic optimization technologies.

- Ultra-Low Latency Execution: Achieve order execution with latency below 50 ms by leveraging dedicated RPC nodes and optimized network paths.

- Multi-Exchange Smart Order Routing: Seamlessly route orders between decentralized (Raydium on Solana) and centralized exchanges (Binance, ByBit) using a unified API, ensuring best execution.

- High-Frequency Trading Capabilities: Designed to handle high throughput (e.g., 10.5k operations per second) for rapid and efficient trading.

- Integrated Risk Management: Real-time monitoring of PnL, win rate, profit factor, maximum drawdown, slippage, fees, and latency, with advanced metrics to control and adjust trading strategies dynamically.

- Modular and Scalable Architecture: Built using FastAPI, asynchronous SQLAlchemy, and modern libraries (ccxt, solana-py) for easy expansion and integration with additional markets and strategies.

- Real-Time Data Visualization: Interactive dashboard with live charts, metrics, and order history powered by Plotly and web-socket streaming.

- Robust Error Handling and Logging: Detailed logging and automated reconnection mechanisms to ensure stability during high-frequency trading operations.

- Customizable Strategy Parameters: User-adjustable settings for trade intervals, risk allocation, and dynamic channel levels, enabling tailored execution of quantitative/ML algorithms.

- Parameters for optimizing capital allocation based on volatility and predictive signals

## 3. integration with additional exchanges (DEX and CEX)

### DEX:
In addition to Raydium on Solana, add support for Ethereum DEX (Uniswap, SushiSwap) as well as other blockchains (e.g. PancakeSwap for BSC)

### CEX:
Expand integration to work with exchanges such as Kraken, Coinbase Pro, FTX, and others via a unified CCXT library that allows multiple exchanges to work through a single API

## Improved  productivity

Expansion of backtesting and simulation capabilities:
- Historical analysis module with the ability to backtest new strategies and parameters
- Simulation of different market scenarios to optimize algorithms
